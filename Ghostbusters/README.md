# Project 4: Ghostbusters

This project implements Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. We advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency. (How the tables have turned ;))


1. **Hidden Markov Model**: Here, Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pac-Man world.

2. **Inference via Particle Filering**:  Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters. Joint Particle Observation is also implemented.

# Project 1: Search Algorithms

This project implements various uninformed and informed search strategies which are described in detail below. The aim of the project is to maximize pacman's utility function to both reach a particular location and collect food efficiently.

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Implemented depth-first search using stack data structure to implement fringe.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Implemented breadth-first search using queue data structure to implement fringe.

3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Implemented uniform cost search using priority queue data structure to implement fringe.

4. **A* Search**: Designed a heuristic function that accounts for the state in the search problem and the refernce information to find optimal path using Manhattan distance.

5. **Corners Problem**: Defined a state representation that encodes all the information necessary to detect whether all four corners have been reached.Designed admissible and consistent heuristic

6. **Food Search Problem**: Search problem and heuristic for pacman to eat all active dots on board.
